# Welcome to Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Repository (WIP)

## About

This is a Mini Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) of Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of reviews from IMDB, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with `sklearn`. For detailed walkthrough, please view the notebooks in the follwing order:

## Problem Definition and Motivation

How can we predict a movie's rating (positive or negative) solely based on its review?

## Datasets

We used a couple of datasets for training and testing purposes, which are the [IMDB review dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utathya/imdb-review-dataset) and another [control IMDB dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shubhamptrivedi/sentiment-analysis-on-imdb-movie-reviews/data?select=IMDB+Dataset.csv) as a benchmark for our model.

We went ahead and cleaned the datasets to our needs and save it into a separate zipped csv file.

## How we approach our problems

| Problems | Our solution |
| :------: | ------------ |
| Long training time | We tried reducing the amount of input features for our model by removing words that did not appeat frequent enough, by doing so we can train our model in a couple minutes. | 
| Long dataset preprocessing time | We saved the processed dataset into a csv file so we can just load the cleaned dataset whenever we need to use it in the future. |
| 1st dataset came with a large quantity of unlabelled data which prevents us from training the model on a random test-train spilt | We introduced another dataset to serve as a test dataset for our model. |

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- We used `matplotlib`, `wordcloud`, `seaborn` and other modules to help us visualise the data we had in hand.

## Neural Network model

- We tried training the model using `sklearn`'s many already pre-built model, we ended using `sklearn`'s neural network Multi-Layer Preceptron [`sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html) as our machine learning model on classifying the movie reviees into positive or negative.

## Outcome

- After optimising the parameters of our model, we managed to get a maximum of around 76% accuracy on our control dataset.

- We had save the model into our pretrained_models directory for future use. Here are more details on the score of the model.

## What we had learned

- We learnt that they are many data preprocessing to be done before even starting to make and train the machine learning model.

- We also learnt how to use `sklearn`'s Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier in machine learning.

- We learned that they are many data preprocessing to be done before even starting to make and train the machine learning model.

- Being exposed to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier using Scikit Learn.


## Conclusion

- Machine Learning can be used for Natural Language Processing, and for predicting the positive and negative sentiment of movie reviews, in spite of the accuracy not being really high.

- Natural Language Processing is very well-suited to handling and analysing raw human text data. In this project we were able to get hands on quickly processing large quantities of movie reviews to obtain an overall sentiment of it. In the age of Big Data where machines are expected to seamlessly deliver insights to the collective data generated by everyone on the internet, applications like these allow businesses and movie-goers to get a basic estimate of the impressions toward a movie. Despite the limited results that were obtained, we hope to create a good foundation to explore other tools to provide deeper insights on movie reviews and understand the complex human emotions that lie behind their words.

## Demo

We can go to [the demo file](./demo.ipynb) to test our pretrained model on the test dataset. There, we can even input our own movie review (and label) to test our machine learning model.
